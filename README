== BlockBrowser

This application lets you browse the bitcoin blockchain
using bitcoin-ruby.

It is highly experimental, use at your own risk.

== Requirements

* ruby (1.9.3, might work with older versions)
* rubygems, bundler
* rails 3.1.3
* bitcoin-ruby (currently the 'blockchain' branch of my repo 'mhanne' on github)

== Setup

You must have a blockchain SQL database according to the libbitcoin schema.

Edit `config/database.yml` to point to that database.

bundle install

rails s
