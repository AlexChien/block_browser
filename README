== BlockBrowser

This application lets you browse the bitcoin blockchain
using bitcoin-ruby.

It is highly experimental, use at your own risk.

== Requirements

* ruby (1.9.3, might work with older versions)
* rubygems, bundler
* rails 3.1.3
* bitcoin-ruby (currently the 'blockchain' branch of my repo 'mhanne' on github)

== Setup

You must have a blockchain database built by bitcoin-ruby.

Create `config/application.yml` to point to the database and set the network:

 network: bitcoin
 database: dummy
 # database: sequel::sqlite:/
 # database: sequel::postgres:/bitcoin

Also, add the corresponding db library to the `Gemfile`:

 # gem 'sequel'
 # gem 'sqlite3'
 # gem 'pg'

Then install the required gems

 bundle install

And start the server
